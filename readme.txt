CyclesMod is a mod for the game "The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing" (DSI/Accolade, 1989) that allows you to edit the configuration of the motorbikes and override the default values of the game.

The game allows the player to choose one of three bikes: 125, 250 or 500cc. The functional parameters of these are contained in a binary file named BIKES.INF. First of all, CyclesMod translates this file into a human-readable text format, so that you can understand and edit these parameters; then the program converts this text file into a new BIKES.INF binary file so that you can play with your modded motorcycles.
