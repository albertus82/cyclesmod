CyclesMod is a utility for the DOS game "The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing" (DSI/Accolade, 1989) that allows you to edit the configuration of the motorbikes, overriding their default settings.

The game allows the player to choose one of three bikes: 125, 250 or 500cc. The functional parameters of these ones are contained in a binary file named BIKES.INF. CyclesMod translates this file into a human-manageable form, so that you can understand and edit these parameters; then the program reconverts this text file into a new BIKES.INF binary file so that you can play with your modded motorcycles.

This utility is written in Java and requires the JRE 6.
